            <h3>Dimple Patel, Epitome of peace, 2020
            </h3>
            <p>In a captivating acrylic painting on canvas, Buddha sits in tranquil contemplation, 
                draped in saffron robes. A white pigeon graces his serene presence, symbolizing peace and purity. The vibrant strokes of acrylic blend ethereal hues, creating an abstract yet harmonious scene that speaks to the profound connection between spiritual enlightenment and the essence of tranquility.</p>

            <h3>Dimple Patel, Dancing Girl, 2019</h3>
            <p>In a mesmerizing blend of oil painting techniques, strokes 
                of vibrant colors fuse in an abstract backdrop, reminiscent of swirling emotions and shifting energies. Amidst this dynamic canvas, a contemporary dancing girl emerges, her form fluid and graceful, captured in intricate brushwork that embodies the essence of movement and rhythm.</p>

            <h3>Vincent van Gogh, The Starry Night, 1889
            </h3>
            <p>Vincent Van Gogh’s most popular painting, The Starry Night was created by Van Gogh at the asylum in Saint-Rémy, where he’d committed himself in 1889. Indeed, The Starry Night seems to reflect his turbulent state of mind at the time, as the night sky comes alive with swirls and orbs of frenetically applied brush marks springing from the yin and yang of his personal demons and awe of nature.</p>

            <h3>Claude Monet, Impression, Sunrise, 1874
            </h3>
            <p>The defining figure of Impressionism, Monet virtually gave the movement its name with his painting of daybreak over the port of Le Havre, the artist’s hometown. Monet was known for his studies of light and color, and this canvas offers a splendid example with its flurry of brush strokes depicting the sun as an orange orb breaking through a hazy blue melding of water and sky.</p>
